# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮  

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**, implemented in Python! This classic game is designed for fun, letting you play against the computer. Test your luck and logic! ✨  

---

## Features 🌟
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Input your choice, and the computer picks randomly.  
- **Simplified Logic**: Uses numerical comparisons to determine the winner.  
- **Two Versions Included**:
  1. **Version 1**: Detailed conditional checks for each outcome.
  2. **Version 2**: Shortened logic using mathematical differences for simplicity.  

---

## How to Play? 🕹️  
1. Run the code in any Python environment.  
2. Enter your choice when prompted:  
   - `s` for Stone  
   - `p` for Paper  
   - `ss` for Scissor  
3. Watch the computer’s random choice and see if you win!

## Explanation of the Logic 💡  
### Version 1:
- **Approach**: Uses multiple conditional checks (`if-elif`) to cover all possible scenarios.  
- **Example**:  
  - If the computer chooses "Stone" and you choose "Paper," you win because paper wraps stone.

### Version 2:
- **Approach**: Uses the difference between numerical values of choices to simplify comparisons.  
- **Key Difference Values**:  
  - `-1` or `2`: You lose.  
  - `1` or `-2`: You win.
